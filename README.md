This project involves the development of a RESTful API for an online game backend system, utilizing Node.js, the Express framework, and MongoDB:
1.	API Implementation: Develop a RESTful API with well-defined endpoints to facilitate core game actions, including creating game sessions, joining sessions, making moves, and retrieving game statuses.
2.	Security and Stability: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect player data and ensure secure access. Integrate error handling, data validation, and rate limiting to maintain the stability and performance of the API.
3.	Comprehensive Documentation: Provide detailed documentation of the API endpoints, including request and response formats and example usage scenarios, to guide developers in integrating with and contributing to the API.
4.	Azure Deployment: Deploy the API to the Azure cloud platform to demonstrate its scalability and availability, ensuring it can handle real-world usage.
